# VisionAid Python Class Assignments

This repository contains all the Python assignments I have completed as part of the Vision-Aid Python training program.  
Each file in this repo represents one problem or exercise that helped me build my skills in core Python programming.

## About This Repository
The assignments included here cover many important Python topics, such as:
- input and output  
- conditional statements  
- loops and iteration  
- functions  
- string processing  
- list and tuple operations  
- dictionaries  
- file handling  
- email and text analysis  
- small games and logic exercises  
- pattern printing  
- exception handling  

I am still attending the course, so new assignments will continue to be added over the next few weeks.

## Note About Code Style
These assignments were completed over several months as part of a weekly Python class.  
Each exercise was solved using the methods taught during that specific class session.  
At the time of solving these problems, I was not yet aware of more advanced or shorter approaches, and the goal was to practice the concepts and techniques introduced by the instructors.

Because of this, some programs may use basic or longer methods intentionally.  
As my learning progresses, the structure and style of my code continue to improve.  
This repository reflects my learning journey, showing how my understanding of Python grows over time.

## Folder Structure
- **mid-exam/**  
  Contains all my mid-term exam programs.  
  Each file name describes the problem solved.

- All other `.py` files  
  These are regular assignments, each named to clearly indicate its purpose.

## Examples of Assignments
Below are some examples of the types of assignments included in this repository:
- simple-calculator.py
