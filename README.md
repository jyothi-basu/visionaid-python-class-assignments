# VisionAid Python Class Assignments

This repository contains the Python assignments and exercises I completed as part of the **Vision-Aid Python training program**.  
It represents my first structured journey into Python programming and documents my learning progression across the course.

Each file in this repository corresponds to a specific problem or exercise solved during the class, focusing on building a strong foundation in core Python concepts.

## About This Repository

The assignments in this repository cover a wide range of beginner to early-intermediate Python topics, including:

- input and output operations  
- conditional statements  
- loops and iteration  
- user-defined functions  
- string processing  
- list, tuple, and dictionary operations  
- file handling  
- email and text analysis  
- small games and logic-based programs  
- pattern printing  
- basic exception handling  

The purpose of this repository is to **demonstrate consistent practice, logical problem-solving, and gradual improvement** rather than advanced optimization.

## Note About Code Style and Approach

These programs were written over several months as part of a **weekly instructor-led Python class**.

At the time of writing many of these programs, I was not yet familiar with more advanced or optimized approaches.  
The solutions intentionally use the techniques taught during the respective class sessions.

Because of this:
- some programs may use simpler or longer methods
- advanced features were avoided unless introduced in class

This repository reflects my **learning journey**, not polished production code.

## Folder Structure

### **regular-exercises/**
Contains daily and regular class exercises completed throughout the course.  
These focus on reinforcing individual concepts such as conditions, loops, lists, dictionaries, strings, and file handling.

---

### **mid-exam-problems/**
Contains all problems solved during the **mid-term examination**.  
Each file name clearly describes the problem being solved.

---

### **final-exam-problems/**
Contains all problems solved during the **final examination**.  
These programs are more comprehensive and integrate multiple concepts together, such as:
- nested data structures
- file processing
- logical condition handling
- object-oriented programming basics

## Team Project (Course Requirement)

As part of the Vision-Aid Python course, I also worked on a **team-based project** titled **Expense Tracker**.

The Expense Tracker is a command-line application that allows users to:
- record expense entries
- store expenses in a file
- list expenses by date or category
- calculate totals
- delete entries using an ID

This project was developed collaboratively as a team project.  
I participated as a **team member** (not the repository owner).

### My Contribution

My responsibilities in the project included:
- listing expenses by **date**
- listing expenses by **category**
- filtering expense records based on user input
- displaying structured and readable output for filtered results
