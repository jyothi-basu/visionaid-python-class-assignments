# VisionAid Python Class Assignments

This repository contains Python assignments and exercises completed as part of the **VisionAid Python training program**.  
It represents my foundational work in Python programming and documents my progression through structured practice and problem-solving.

Each file corresponds to a specific problem solved during the course, with a focus on building strong fundamentals in core Python concepts.

---

## Purpose

This repository serves as a public record of my foundational Python practice, focusing on logical problem-solving, data handling, and automation-oriented thinking using core Python features.

The goal is to demonstrate consistency, clarity of thought, and gradual skill development rather than advanced optimization or production-level design.

## About This Repository

The assignments in this repository cover a range of **foundational to early-intermediate Python topics**, including:

- input and output operations  
- conditional statements  
- loops and iteration  
- user-defined functions  
- string processing  
- list, tuple, and dictionary operations  
- file handling  
- email and text analysis  
- logic-based programs and small games  
- pattern printing  
- basic exception handling  

Each program is self-contained and named descriptively to indicate the problem it solves.

## Note on Code Style

The programs in this repository were developed over several months as part of an **instructor-led Python training program**.

They primarily use the concepts covered during the course, emphasizing correctness and clarity over advanced optimization.  
As a result, some solutions may be more verbose or use simpler approaches.

This repository is intended to reflect foundational understanding, consistent practice, and logical reasoning rather than polished production code.

## Folder Structure

### **regular-exercises/**
Contains daily and regular class exercises completed throughout the course.  
These focus on reinforcing individual concepts such as conditions, loops, strings, data structures, and file handling.

---

### **mid-exam-problems/**
Contains all problems solved during the **mid-term examination**.  
Each file addresses a clearly defined problem and applies concepts taught up to that stage of the course.

---

### **final-exam-problems/**
Contains all problems solved during the **final examination**.  
These programs integrate multiple concepts together, including:
- file processing  
- logical condition handling  
- nested data structures  
- basic object-oriented programming concepts

## Team Project (Course Requirement)

As part of the VisionAid Python course, I participated in a **team-based project** titled **Expense Tracker**.

The Expense Tracker is a command-line application that allows users to:
- record expense entries  
- store expenses in a file  
- list expenses by date or category  
- calculate totals  
- delete entries using a unique ID  

The project was developed collaboratively as a course requirement.  
I participated as a **team member** (not the repository owner).

### My Contribution

My responsibilities in the project included:
- listing expenses by **date**  
- listing expenses by **category**  
- filtering expense records based on user input  
- displaying structured and readable output for filtered results
