# VisionAid Python Class Assignments

This repository contains all the Python assignments I have completed as part of the Vision-Aid Python training program.  
Each file in this repo represents one problem or exercise that helped me build my skills in core Python programming.

## About This Repository
The assignments included here cover many important Python topics, such as:
- input and output  
- conditional statements  
- loops and iteration  
- functions  
- string processing  
- list, tuple, and dictionary operations  
- file handling  
- email and text analysis  
- small games and logic-based programs  
- pattern printing  
- basic exception handling  

This repository serves as a record of my coursework and learning progression during the Vision-Aid Python program.

## Note About Code Style
These assignments were completed over several months as part of a weekly Python class.  
Each problem was solved using the methods taught during the respective class sessions.

At the time of writing many of these programs, I was not yet familiar with more advanced or optimized approaches.  
The intention was to practice and reinforce the concepts introduced by the instructors.

Because of this, some programs may use simpler or longer methods intentionally.  
This repository reflects my learning journey and gradual improvement in understanding Python programming.

## Folder Structure
- **regular-exercises/**  
  Contains daily and regular class exercises completed during the course.

- **mid-exam/**  
  Contains all the problems I solved in the mid-term examination.  
  Each file name clearly describes the problem solved.

- **final-exam/**  
  Contains all the problems I solved in the final examination.

## Team Project (Course Requirement)

As part of the Vision-Aid Python course, I also worked on a **team-based project** named **Expense Tracker**.

The Expense Tracker is a command-line application that allows users to:
- record expense entries
- store expenses in a file
- list expenses by date or category
- calculate totals
- delete entries using an ID

This project was developed collaboratively as a team.  
I contributed as a **team member** (not the repository owner).

### My Contribution
My responsibility in the project was implementing the following features:
- listing expenses by **date**
- listing expenses by **category**
- filtering expense records based on user input
- displaying structured output for filtered results
