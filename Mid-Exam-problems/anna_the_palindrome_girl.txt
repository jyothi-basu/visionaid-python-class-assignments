Anna was living with her mom after her dad passed away an year ago. One day, Anna discovered her dad notebook with the words MADAM! MADAM! MADAM! BEWARE!!! written on its cover page. She noticed some more words like Malayalam racecar kayak deed scribbled many times. While she was trying to read further Her mom warned her to throw it away but Anna refused. She was curious to know what those words meant!

One evening Anna went to the boathouse with one kayak floating at the dock. In the kayak she found this message: **! The deed is done Beware of madam **! reading this. Her heart raced, She whispered the words softly racecar kayak deed still searching for meaning!

Suddenly her mom appeared. She said Anna your father failed to stop me. Now it is your turn The notebook does not explain the past It tells you what to do next!

Anna stepped back clutching the notebook. She said You are not my MOM The woman smiled and said, you are right your mom is the MADAM on the cover page!

Anna looked again at the notebook. Reading carefully she noticed the strange words MALAYALAM RACECAR KAYAK MADAM DEED They were the same forward and backward. She realized they were all palindromes and thought oh my god! even my name palindrome!

Anna was left with three questions unanswered;
